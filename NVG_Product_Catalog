## CATALOG STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Primary Categorization Logic

**Top-level Product Categories:** 2

1. **Graphic Speciality** – Encompasses all papers, boards, and coatings for graphic, packaging, publishing, art, and premium print applications
2. **Labels** – Encompasses all pressure-sensitive label constructions (paper, film, and special configurations)

### Secondary Grouping Within Graphic Speciality

Products are grouped primarily by **material family and end-use positioning**:

- **Covering** – Decorative and functional covering papers
- **Colored Board** – Vibrant boards from FAVINI and other suppliers
- **White & Cream** – Bright and neutral-tone papers
- **Kraft Papers & Boards** – Virgin kraft materials for printing/coating
- **Black Paper & Board / Recycled** – Recycled and sustainable black materials
- **Textures** – Textured specialty boards (22 designs)
- **Recycled Papers** – Eco-friendly papers from post-consumer waste and agricultural by-products
- **Favini Art** – Premium art and watercolour papers with high cotton content
- **Hi Print** – Premium printing and packaging grades
- **Laid & Felt Mark** – Papers with distinctive textured finishes
- **Coated** – Metallic and specialty coated papers

### Secondary Grouping Within Labels

Products are grouped first by **face material type**, then by **technical construction**:

- **Paper Labels** – Uncoated and coated paper face stocks (Maplitho, Chromo, High Gloss, Cast Coated, Fluorescent, Gold Paper, Metallised Paper, Metallised Holographic)
- **Film Labels** – Synthetic films and polyester/PVC substrates (PVC Clear, Synthetic, Poly Clear, Poly Opaque, Poly Metallised, PVC Metallised)
- **Special Labels** – Special adhesive systems and constructions (Removable, Piggy Back, Eco-friendly, Kraft Paper, Black Paper, Sandwich)

### Printing Method Classification

Printing methods (Offset, Flexo, Barcode, Digital) are **not primary categorization drivers**. Instead:
- They appear as **attributes** within label product tables, denoted "PRINT APPLICATION"
- Each label SKU variant indicates compatibility via checkmarks (✓) or "Not Recommended" (✗/NR) notation
- Graphic Speciality products occasionally reference print processes in application descriptions but are primarily defined by material and visual properties

### Naming Patterns

#### Graphic Speciality

- **Brand/Range names** (e.g., Burano, Sumo, Eco White, Biancoflash, Vintage, Influience, Shiro Echo, Crush Corn, Majestic, Tube, Prisma, Twill, Contact Laid, Brilliant Black)
- **Variant differentiation** by:
  - Colour (Orange, Bordeaux, Fire Red, White, Black, etc.)
  - Shade (White, Natural, Ivory, Bright White)
  - Size (64 x 92, 70 x 100, 71 x 102, 72 x 102 cm)
  - GSM or thickness (90–350 gsm; 700/1050 gsm for boards; 240–300 gsm for cotton papers)

#### Labels

- **Family name + short code** (e.g., MAPLITHO – ML, CHROMO – C1S, HIGH GLOSS – HMC, CAST COATED – MC, FLUORESCENT – FL)
- **Numerical/letter construction codes** encoding face weight, adhesive type, and backing (e.g., 70/50 CCK, C1S 80/60 G, MET SILVER/70 SCK, PVC CLEAR/140 CCK, POLY OPAQUE MATT/60 G)
- **Print method flags** indicated by column headers (Offset, Flexo, Barcode, Digital) with checkmark notation
- **Sheet size and quantity** specified per variant (e.g., 20" x 30", 100 sheets; 12" x 18", 13" x 19", 200 sheets)

### Key Observations

1. **Label SKU Density:** The label product range contains significantly more SKUs (construction variants) than Graphic Speciality, reflecting modular design (face stock + adhesive + backing combinations)

2. **Technical Data:** Label products reference technical specification PDFs (e.g., "MAPLITHO 70/100 CCK", "C1S 80/100 CCK"), suggesting detailed technical datasheets are available but not fully transcribed in web pages

3. **Size Standardization:** 
   - Graphic Speciality uses metric dimensions (cm) with relatively consistent sizes across families
   - Labels use imperial dimensions (inches) with two primary sheet sizes (20" x 30" and digital sizes 12" x 18", 13" x 19")

4. **Material Sourcing:** 
   - Several Graphic Speciality families reference FAVINI as a supplier (Burano, Sumo, contact Laid, others)
   - Label products appear to be manufactured/sourced by NVG directly, with proprietary construction codes

5. **Sustainability Positioning:** 
   - Recycled Papers (Shiro Echo, Crush Corn)
   - Black Paper & Board (Brilliant Black, Shiro Echo Raw Black)
   - Eco-friendly Special Label
   - Are explicitly marketed for environmental responsibility
